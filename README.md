Working On More

## How to run
Upon running the file ```EncyptMethods.py``` you will be presented with a loop driven menu, the method of encryption can be accessed by entering the option number beside each method

## How to help
Any help will be much appreciated and you guys can submit a Pull request submitting different methods of encryption as a seperate file(The algorithim must be defined as a fucntion), the file must be named in Camelcase
Once the file has been added, dont forget to import and call the fucntion in the main file as well as add the option into the menu
